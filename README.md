# Daanish Hindustani | Software Engineer at Thomson Reuters

## About Me
Versitile Developer with a strong foundation in machine learning, artificial intelligence, generative AI, AWS, cloud computing, DevOps, FullStack, and Ios. Currently an intern at Thomson Reuters DevOps team, where I develop cloud services and tools on AWS, implement CI/CD pipelines, and ensure seamless code integration, testing, and deployment. Previously, I led machine learning research at the University of Minnesota College of Engineering, focusing on detecting and forecasting famines in Afghanistan. Published papers and articles on machine learning, including "Tackling Tuberculosis: A Comparative Dive into Machine Learning for Tuberculosis Detection." With a history of streamlining operations through automation, I have a strong background in building applications and developing scripts to modernize and optimize business tools.
